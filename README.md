<h1>Tertis Game using Python </h1><br>
Players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces.<br>
<br>
In this we used "pygame" module as well as "Random" module<br>
The pygame module is used to build the structure and the design of the game using the 2 dimensional matrix<br>
The random module is used to give block of the game in random order..
